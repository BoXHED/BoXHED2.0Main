# BoXHED2.0Main

For information on the functionalities of BoXHED2.0, please refer to [BoXHED1.0 Paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20o/wang20o.pdf) published in ICML 2020.

In order to install BoXHED2.0 locally, the steps are as follows:

1. **cloning the repo**: first BoXHED2.0Main needs to be cloned. For doing so, you may run the following command:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/BoXHED/BoXHED2.0Main.git
```
2. **setting up conda**: We highly recommend devoting a conda environment to BoXHED2.0. This step makes sure BoXHED2.0 will not interfere with XGBoost (the library we have borrowed from extensively) when installed.This implementation uses python 3.8. You may create a conda environment named boxhed2.0. To do so, you can go to the cloned BoXHED2.0Main repository, and run the following:
```
conda create -n boxhed2.0 python=3.8
```
Having created the environment, you may run:
```
conda activate boxhed2.0
```
3. **BoXHED2.0 Installation**: You may run the setup bash script by:
```
bash setup.sh
```
3. **running BoXHED2.0**: we have included our synthetic data simulation as an example of how to use BoXHED2.0 in *main.py*. You may run it as:
```
python main.py
```
